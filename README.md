# Arrays and Classes

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

## Description

We spent time going over how to create and instantiate a class. For this assignment, come up with five of your own examples. They should each have a comment explaining what the class represents. In the Groovy console, make sure you can instantiate the class and set all of its fields. Optional: Try to make some of your fields arrays if it makes sense to.

## Example

```java
// Stores a single tweet.

public class Tweet {
    String text;
    String username;
    int timestamp;
    boolean isPrivate;
}
```
